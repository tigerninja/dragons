                Komodo Dragon<br>
                Phylum: Chordate <br>
                Class: Repitila <br>
                Order: Squamata<br>
                Family: Varanidae<br>
                Genus/species: Varanus komodoensis<br>
                
                Though Komodo Dragons have fairly good eyesight and are good at spotting prey who are moving, it is their keen sense of smell that sets them apart as predators. Komodo dragons kill their prey by infecting them with their extremely poisonous saliva through wounds inflicted by their exceptionally sharp teeth. They are native to Indonesia, where the islands of Komodo, Gila Motang, Rinca, and Flores are home to a stable population of 3,000 to 5,000 at any given time. The species is still considered endangered, however, due to poaching, human expansion, natural disasters, and a shortage of fertile females.

                <strong>Flying Dragon (Draco Volans)</strong> <br>
                Phylum: Chordate <br>
                Class: Repitila <br>
                Order: Squamata <br>

                "Flying dragons" glide through the air on cape-like "wings" of skin which stretch out from their moveable ribs. Though clumsy on the ground, the flying dragon can glide for meters when threatened by a predator. The glides are steered by their tails. These lizards are native to the Philippines and Borneo, and Southeast Asia and survive an a diet of ants and termites. They have avoided human endangerment in some areas due to a popular misconception that they are poisonous. As such, they have no official conservation status and are not currently considered to be an endangered species.

                Bearded Dragon (Pogona) <br>
                Phylum: Chordate <br>
                Class: Repitila <br>
                Order: Squamata<br>

                The bearded dragon takes its name from a defense mechanism in which the dark "beard of spiky scales on its neck area turn black and expand. Though both sexes of bearded dragon have this ability, it is more frequently invoked by the males of the species, who utilize it while attracting mates, as well as when they feel threatened. Bearded dragons are also notable for their habit of standing on three legs and waving the fourth, as a sign of species recognition or submission. They are native to the Eastern regions of Australia, where they subsist on an omnivorous diet. They are not an engangered species.

                There are more than 5,000 species of dragonflies, all of which can fly up and down as well as sideways, and can hover like helicopters. They can also see in every direction except for directly behind them, since almost their entire head is an eye. Dragonflies eat other insects while flying, so those without the ability to fly tend to starve to death.  Because dragonflies live in water during their larval periods, adult dragonflies are also found near water. One of the first species of flying insects to evolve, fossils have been found of dragonflies at least twelve times as large as those we see today!
