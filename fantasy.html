                Black Dragons are the most malicious and ruthless out of all the dragons. They live in caverns in marshy wet lands.
                They are often referred to as Skull dragons because of their spiny faces. Their most powerful weapon is their acid
                breath.

                Blue dragons are tricky creatures playing on the minds of travelers or anyone in their path. They use a special
                ability to make their victims hallucinate. When they are not manipulating their prey, they defend themselves with lightning 
                breath.They are an anomaly among other dragons because they live in an organized ranking society.

            	    Green Dragons are supremely territorial war-like beasts. They have combative personalities and love to betray, con 
                    or cheat anyone who will make a deal with them. The will assail their victims for any reason rational or not. Their 
                    strongest weapon is a green cloud of lethal gas spouting from their mouth.

                    Red Dragons are extremely greedy, sinister beasts. They are obsessed with the cultivation of their treasure troves
                    or their own person. They are the most powerful of the Chromatic dragons and are vainly presumptuous. Their weapon is a cone 
                    of fire from their lungs

        	    White Dragons live in icy arctic habitats. While the white dragon is the weakest of all dragons, they are ferocious
                and intelligent. Their flying abilities are exceptional and they prefer swimming in freezing water. Their special ability
                is breathing a cone of frosty ice.
